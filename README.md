# Customer_Churn_Prediction 

This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn, helping organizations retain valuable customers by identifying those most at risk of leaving. The analysis includes multiple models to optimize prediction accuracy, culminating in a Logistic Regression model with an accuracy of 79%.<br>

Key Models and Techniques<br>
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling of missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.<br><br>
Model Selection:<br>
Logistic Regression: Achieved 79% accuracy.<br>
Random Forest with Randomized Cross-Validation: Enhanced performance with hyperparameter tuning.<br>
XGBoost: A robust ensemble model for further predictive accuracy.<br>
Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Built with TensorFlow and Keras for deeper pattern recognition.<br>

Results and Insights<br>
The project highlights the effectiveness of logistic regression for this dataset, supported by ensemble models and ANN for comparative insights. This predictive tool provides actionable insights for enhancing customer retention.<br>
